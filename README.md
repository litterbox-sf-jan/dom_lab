# DOM Lab

This lab will ask you to utilize some of the DOM manipulation and
event handling techniques discussed in class.

## The Setup

We have provided you with `index.html`. You should investigate the
code we've given you.  You won't need to edit this file, but it will
be helpful to be familiar with its contents.

We've also given you `main.css`. You also won't need to edit this
file, and in fact there is only one style present.

There are several images you will need to access in the `images/`
directory.

All of your work will occur in `app.js`. You'll have to write
JavaScript to accomplish all of the goals below.

## Steps

In `app.js`, write the necessary JavaScript to:

1. change the greeting from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, Planet Earth!".

2. set the `backgroundColor` of each `<li>` to `yellow`.

3. add the class of `selected` to an `<li>` when it is clicked.

4. change the image to be the most recently clicked food item.

5. clicking the reset button should remove the `selected` class from
  each `<li>` and change the image to `panic.jpeg`.

## Hints

- If none of your code works, have you considered the `load` event?
- You may need to loop over the grocery list for some of these
  operations.
- There is more than one way to add/remove a class to/from an
  element, including some we did not cover in class.
